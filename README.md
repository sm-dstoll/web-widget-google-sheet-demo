# web-widget-google-sheet-demo

This webpage will serve to present a slide deck created in Google Slides with a digital person web widget overlay. For each use case, the HTML file will need to be updated with the embed code for the Google Slide deck, as well as a new DDNAS web API key for the digital person. For the DDNAS API key, you will need to whitelist the `https://sm-dstoll.github.io` domain.
